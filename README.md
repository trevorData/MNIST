### How three algorithms classify handwritten digits as they are being drawn

---

The three algorithms are (from top to bottom):  

1. A Dense Neural Network with two hidden layers - 93.35% accuracy on test data  
1. A Convolutional Neural Network feat pooling and dropout layers - 98.45% accuracy on test data  
1. A K Nearest Neighbors Classifier with k=5 - 96.1% accuracy on test data

For the two neural networks the bar graphs represent the predicted probabilities for each digit given by the output layer of the network. For the KNN the bar graph represents what portion of the 5 nearest neighbors are in each class.
